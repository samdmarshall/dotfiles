# WordCount (wc) Plugin #

The wc plugin provides the user with the ability to count either
characters or strings in any text being edited with micro. 

A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white 
space characters.  White space characters are the set of characters
for which the iswspace(3) function returns true. 

Character count includes white space.

To initiate the function, you can either:

Press "F5"

Or run:

```
> wc
```
