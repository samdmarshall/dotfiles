;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides a method for quickly calculating how many
;; lines in a given project. It is inspired by `find-file-in-project'.

;; It depends on the command `find', `wc', `rev' and `sort'.
;; find . -type f \( -name "*.el" -or -name "*.elc" \) -not -regex ".*/elpa/.*"

;; Installation
;; It is recommended installed by the ELPA package system.
;; You could install it by M-x: with
;; package-install: how-many-lines-in-project.

;; Usage
;; M-x: how-many-lines-in-project

;; There are some variables you may need to config.
;; `hm-lines-file-extensions'
;; `hm-lines-sort-by-type'
;; `hm-lines-find-regex'
