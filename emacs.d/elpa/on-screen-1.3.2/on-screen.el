;;; Commentary:

;; Scrolling can be distracting because your eyes may lose
;; orientation.  This library implements a minor mode that highlights
;; the previously visible buffer part after each scroll.
;;
;; Installation: Put this library somewhere in your load-path, or
;; install via M-x package-list-packages.  Then add to your init-file:
;;
;;   (require 'on-screen)
;;
;; To invoke on-screen globally for all buffers, also add
;;
;;   (on-screen-global-mode +1)
;;
;; Alternatively you can use the buffer local version `on-screen-mode'.
;; For example, add this line to your init file:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'Info-mode-hook 'on-screen-mode)
;;
;; to enable it in all Info buffers.
;;
;; By default, fringe markers are used for highlighting - see
;; `on-screen-highlight-method' to change that.  Type M-x
;; customize-group RET on-screen RET to see what else can be
;; configured.  If you use a configuration file (.emacs), you may also
;; want to define mode specific settings by using buffer local
;; variables.  For example, to use non intrusive fringe markers by
;; default, but transparent overlays in w3m, you would add
;;
;;   (add-hook
;;    'w3m-mode-hook
;;    (defun my-w3m-setup-on-screen ()
;;      (setq-local on-screen-highlight-method 'shadow)))
;;
;; to your .emacs.
;;
;; If you use transparent overlays for highlighting and there is the
;; library "hexrgb.el" in your `load-path', it will be used to compute
;; highlighting colors dynamically instead of using constant faces.
;; I.e. if you use non-default background colors (e.g. from custom
;; themes), on-screen will try to perform highlighting with a
;; suitable, slightly different color.  See
;; `on-screen-highlighting-to-background-delta' to control this.
;;
;;
;; Implementation notes (mainly for myself):
;;
;; Implementing this functionality is not as straightforward as one
;; might think.  There are commands that scroll other windows than the
;; current one.  Not only scrolling commands can scroll text - also
;; editing or even redisplay can cause windows to scroll.  There is
;; weird stuff such as folding and narrowing, influencing the visible
;; buffer part.  And although highlighting is realized in the
;; displayed buffers (with overlays), it must be organized on a
;; per-window basis, because different buffer parts may be displayed
;; in different windows, and their highlightings must not interfere.
;;
;; That all makes it necessary to observe windows via hacks in
;; different hooks, and to manage information about buffers, visible
;; parts and timers in a data structure (`on-screen-data').  It is
;; realized as an association list whose keys are windows.  There are
;; some pitfalls - e.g. the data can be out of date if the window
;; configuration has changed and windows display different buffers
;; now.  The data must be updated, but not simply be thrown away,
;; because the highlightings in the old buffers must be removed
;; nonetheless.
;;
;;
;; Acknowledgments:
;;
;; This library was inspired by a similar feature of the "Conqueror"
;; web browser.
